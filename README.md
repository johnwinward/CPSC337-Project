# CPSC337-Project
A website for a made-up business as a project for my web development course.

On the Home page, the list in the "What do we sell" section changes backround color for any listing with a mouse hovered over it.

On the About Us page, my dynamic CSS feature happens when a mouse is hovered over each console. The background color changes, and a sparkle .gif file
plays in the background. The text also changes color to be more readable when this effect is active.

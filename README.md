# CPSC337-Project
A website for a made-up business as a project for my web development course.

The project runs on ASP.NET (not Core). To run, clone project, open Visual Studio solution file, and build/execute.

Features:
1. On the Home page, the list in the "What do we sell" section changes backround color for any listing with a mouse hovered over it.

2. On the About Us page, my dynamic CSS feature happens when a mouse is hovered over each console. The background color changes, and a sparkle .gif file
plays in the background. The text also changes color to be more readable when this effect is active.

3. In aboutUs.js, jQuery selectors are used for mostly everything. jQuery is also used to modify the DOM.

4. In repairs.js, jQuery is used to obtain the selected values in the form.
